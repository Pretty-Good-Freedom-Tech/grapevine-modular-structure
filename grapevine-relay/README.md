Grapevine Relays

## Personalized Grapevine WoT Relay

The Personalized Grapevine WoT Relay differs from other nostr relays in two major ways:

1. It stores Scorecards (G tables) and Ratings (R tables) in the form of NIP-51 lists that are significantly larger than what most nostr relays will accomodate.
2. It uses Grapevine data to curate what data is stored and what data gets culled from the relay.

## GRaas: Grapevine Relay as a Service

GRaaS, the Grapevine Relay as a Service, is similar to a Personalized Grapevine WoT Relay, except that it serves multiple customers. The relationship between Personalized Grapevine WoT Relays and GRaaS remains to be seen.
