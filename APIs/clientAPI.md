Client API
=====

This is the API between the Calculation Engine and any third party nostr client, e.g. Coracle.

Work in progress. 

This will likely be the last API to build. In the early stages of development of the ecosystem, nostr clients will likely access GrapeRank data via personalized Grapevine WoT Relays rather than through the client API.
